FINAL RESULTS:

/Users/andrei/work/itc-benchmarks/04.wo_Defects_Cpp/main.cpp:23:  [2] (integer) atoi:
  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
